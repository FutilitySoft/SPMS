<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">These are the official rules for the <?=$shipname?>.  Please keep in mind the following guidelines for new members:</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>1. This <?=$shipname?> simulation is more than a battleship.  We are about character development and the dialogue that develops among the simmers. This is not to say however that the <?=$shipname?> has no action.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>2. Please take your time on the application. Getting the position you're applying for depends in part on the quality of character that you design on your application. It will also partially depend on your ability to proofread what you have written.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">3. At all times, you as a Starfleet Officer or Crewmember are required to maintain the dignity of the position and to act according to the rules governing the simulation. More plainly: flaming, trolling and profane-filled tirades will not be tolerated by any member of the simulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">4. You must be at least Age 14 or older to participate in this simulation. The <?=$shipname?> simuilation is run from servers in the United States and therefore must adhere to the laws of the United States regarding the exploitation of minors.  Fleet rules also prohibit membership by anyone under the age of 14.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">5. Please attempt to do some Star Trek research regarding the position you are taking. For example, do not apply for the Chief Engineering Officer's position if you have no idea about the basic fundamentals of the technology of the Star Trek universe. If you are looking for a good place to start, try Tactical/Security or Conn/Helm or Medical. All positions are subject to the review of the Commanding Officer.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-size: 9pt">6. The <?=$shipname?> requests ALL players to make an attempt to post at least once per week. It doesn't need to be long or spectacular. It should, if possible, be about your character in the current storyline/plot. If that is not possible (ie. your character is the quartermaster and we are raiding and enemy starbase) then you should post a personal log or something as a sub-plot.  The rules on posting are strictly enforced.  We have a special page for these rules.  You can find them by
</span> <a href="postings.php"><span style="font-size: 9pt">CLICKING HERE</span></a><span style="font-size: 9pt">.</span></font></b></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>By applying to the <?=$shipname?>, you acknowledge you have read and agree with the above. It is also agreed that any rules referred to by direct links to the pages in which they appear are included with these rules as referenced.  These rules are subject to change with or without notice and shall be considered binding once they appear on the website of the <?=$shipname?> currently residing at <? echo("<a href=" . $websiteURL . ">" . $websiteURL . "</a>"); ?>.</b></font></p>
